# Master Thesis: Strategic classification: the impact of user information and non-linear classification models

## Overview
This thesis implements various algorithms and functions for feature shifting and evaluation, utilizing for now a synthetic dataset. 
The main components include cost functions, plotting utilities, and modified regression techniques.

## File Structure

- **best_responses.py**: Contains the feature shifting algorithms that are used to modify features based on specified responses.

- **cost_functions.py**: Implements the cost function that evaluates the performance of the feature shifting algorithms.

- **dataset_0_synthetic.py**: Provides an elementwise simulation and evaluation on a synthetic dataset, enabling testing of the algorithms.

- **plotting.py**: Includes functions for visualizing results, helping to interpret the outcomes of the simulations and algorithms.

- **ridge.py**: Contains a modified version of the ridge regression algorithm, tailored to fit the requirements of the project and accommodate version control.

- **weightedsampler.py**: Implements a weighted sampling method designed for scenarios with no information cases, as described in section 3.2.III of the project documentation.
